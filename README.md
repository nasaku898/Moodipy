# Moodipy
Moodipy helps people identify and validate their emotions through music. This is important because emotions help us know what we want or don’t want. In addition, It lets us solidify interactions with other humans and talk about our feelings and fears more easily. Knowing our emotions allow us to be in control of ourselves and have a clearer state of mind. This provides us with the capability of making decisions rationally and not a decision motivated by some sort of unknown emotion.
